# Stats vs Zombies

The game can be played at: https://stats-vs-zombies.herokuapp.com

It works best in Chrome, and you will need to view in a mobile browser (or on desktop using an emulator e.g. https://developers.google.com/web/tools/chrome-devtools/device-mode)

This project was created as part of a final year project to create a mobile game to teach statistics to undergraduates, using node.js and the excellent JavaScript HTML5 game framework Phaser3 https://phaser.io/phaser3
