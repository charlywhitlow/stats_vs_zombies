# Stats vs Zombies

This project was created as part of a final year project to create a mobile game to teach statistics to undergraduates, using the excellent HTML5 game framework Phaser3: https://phaser.io/phaser3

The game works best in Chrome, and you will need to view in a mobile browser, or using a mobile emulator, e.g. https://developers.google.com/web/tools/chrome-devtools/device-mode

Please note that many parts of the game have not yet been implemented and this is a work in progress.

* The **master** branch contains the the HTML5 game, and can be see in action at: http://users.cs.cf.ac.uk/WhitlowC/stats_vs_zombies

* The **login** branch contains the beginning of a login system for the game in Node.js, and can be viewed at: https://stats-vs-zombies.herokuapp.com
